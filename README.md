1.	Write a C++ programme to multiply opposite values in an array of integers and store the answer in the same positions in the array. 
The solution must be arrived at using recursion. Note, the introduction of a second array to aid the reversal is not permitted. 
Your solution must work for arrays of any size (odd or even). If the array is an odd size, then the middle value will be multiplied by itself, 
and the result stored in that position.


2.	n! means n × (n − 1) × ... × 3 × 2 × 1
     For example, 10! = 10 × 9 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3628800,
     and the sum of the digits in the number 10! is 
		3 + 6 + 2 + 8 + 8 + 0 + 0 = 27.
Write a C++ programme to calculate the factorial of an integer and calculate the sum of the digits of its factorial using recursion.
